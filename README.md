 1. Clone the `mriids2` repo.
 2. `cd` into the `mriids2` repo.
 3. Create a `.env` file at the root and add the contents from the `env.sample` file.
 4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
 5. Run `npm start` to run the app locally in `http://localhost:3000/`
 6. To build the application for deployment, run `npm run build`. This will create a `build` directory in the root of the project which has the optimized production files.
